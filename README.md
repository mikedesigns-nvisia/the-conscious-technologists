## Website Features

This codebase has been specifically structured for optimal web deployment:

### 1. Clean, Semantic HTML

The HTML structure uses proper semantic elements and follows best practices for web standards, making it easy to maintain and extend:

```html
<section id="about" class="py-20 watercolor-bg relative overflow-hidden" aria-labelledby="about-heading">
```

### 2. Modular Asset Structure

All SVG patterns and decorative elements have been extracted into separate files in the `assets/svg/` directory, making them easy to modify or replace:

```css
.hero-gradient {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(240, 247, 244, 0.9) 0%, rgba(210, 235, 227, 0.9) 100%),
                url('assets/svg/diamond-pattern.svg');
    background-size: cover, 100px 100px;
}
```

### 3. Separation of Concerns

All styles and scripts have been separated into their own files for better organization and maintainability:

- `styles.css`: Contains all styling for the website
- `scripts.js`: Contains all interactive functionality including:
  - Form validation
  - Mobile menu toggle
  - Smooth scrolling
  - Form submissions

### 4. Interactive Features

The JavaScript provides complete interactive functionality:

```javascript
// Form validation and submission
function validateForm(form) {
    // Validation logic
}

function submitForm(form) {
    // Submission logic with success message
}
```

### 5. Deployment Ready

The site is ready for immediate deployment to any standard web hosting platform.
